The automated CD deployment is failing on the Release since this morning. It was working fine earlier.
The error is:

1. To remove the agent:
c:/vstsagent/a1> .\config.cmd remove

2. Then get your corp SSL certificate(.pem file) and put it in the root folder of the agent i.e. c:\vsts\a1 in my case. To get the .pem file:

Export CA cert from Trusted Root CA Store, use Base64 Encoding X.509 (.CER) format, name the export cert to something like ca.pem.

**Your ca.pem might looks like following:**
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
(Your Root CA certificate: ca.pem)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----

3. Run the config command again (to configure the agent again with the sslcacert param and anything else you need)
.\config.cmd --sslcacert ca.pem --deploymentgroup --deploymentgroupname "deployment-group-name" --agent $env:COMPUTERNAME --runasservice --work '_work' --url 'https://yourcorpname.visualstudio.com/' --projectname 'your-project-name' --auth PAT --token YOURPATTOKENHERE;

and that's all error fixed.
